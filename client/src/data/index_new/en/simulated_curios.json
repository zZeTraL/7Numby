Ruan Mei's pouch stands at the forefront of such creations.

The A-Ruan Pouch spent the remainder of its time in a display window. Stephen Lloyd once viewed it as his important companion for some reason â€” he never revealed to anyone how he contemplated hiding within the pouch to avoid his family.",

If the Aeons truly stand above all lifeforms and rule supreme, then why would they care about the everyday concerns of mortals? The existence of the sleeping and shapeless IX is proof of that. To show the Self-Annihilators that the Aeons do care, the Doctors of Chaos combined the demon god crafts of the occult monks to create the Sealing Wax of Aeons. It is said that stamping with this Sealing Wax will attract a glimpse from the corresponding Aeon from across space and time â€” There are no successful examples yet, but some Self-Annihilators did regain their faith in the universe, Aeons, and everything else after stamping with this sealing wax.",
